% navrh riesenia (1 - 1,5 normostrany)
% pozriet si prace na crzp ako to ma vyzerat
%   - povedat ze: definovanie problematiky, nacrh riesenia, co treba iresit, a ja konkretne co idem riesie
%   - co je vsetko zle v tomto svete, malo by sa to riesit, a potom ja co konkretne idem riesit

The goal of this thesis is to establish guidelines for ethical handling of artificial intelligence, primarily for novice users and the general public. In our analysis in Sections~\ref{sec:risks}, \ref{sec:content_moderation}, \ref{sec:methods_of_attacks}, we identified a great number of risks of using AI solutions and potential ways to misuse them for adversary purposes. These risks raise questions about the credibility and fair use of LLMs. Lack of transparency of these systems, mainly due to the current state of global legislation and because most systems are so called ''black-box'' which Collins Dictionary~\cite{Collins_BlackBox} defines as anything having a complex function that can be observed but whose inner workings are mysterious or unknown, contribute to the need of these guidelines.

% With the proposed guidelines, our aim is to minimize risks and help increase understanding of these systems with ethics and security in mind.

The guidelines will consist of three main areas:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item introduction to prompt engineering
    \item proposing recommendations for the fair use of language models and security measures
    \item improving the transparency of models through methodologies to increase the explainability of AI decisions % (note: explain using reasoning models (use their output to fact-check themselves))
\end{enumerate}

These guidelines will provide a set of recommendations for the safe and ethical use of language models, drawing on existing standards and best practices in the field of artificial intelligence. The output of the work will be a useful and practical tool to assist the general public and developers in creating prompts, thereby minimizing risks and ensuring responsible use of AI systems.
