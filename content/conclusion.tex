\section{Summary}

The goal of this thesis was to identify ethical and security risks associated with prompt engineering and AI in general to establish guidelines for the ethical and safe use of AI solutions primarily targeting the general public and developers. In this thesis, we first analyzed the current state of AI and identified the risks associated with implementing AI solutions. Secondly, we explored the topics of jailbreaking and methods of attacks on large language models. Thirdly, we analyzed the state of legislation in AI dominent regions such as United States, China and last but not least European Union. After the analysis we proposed a solution (the mentioned guidelines) for the risks associated with AI. In Chapter~\ref{cha:experimenting} we covered the experiments that were carried out on selected LLMs to explore the reality of thrreats posed by some of the identified risks. Laslty we evaluated the risks based on public survey and we also evaluated the experiments. We found that..
