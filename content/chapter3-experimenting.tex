\chapter{Experimenting}

% V tejto kapitole sa budem pokúšať experimentovať s novými a aj zároveň starými LLMs ktoré sa pokúsim brejknúť a ukážem na nich ich etickosť a zároveň ehm či majú nejaké iné obmedzenia napríklad deepseek tajomán square že čo sa tam stalo že to blokuje a takéto veci, chatgpt dan prompts, gemini a ostatné

In this chapter, we will cover experiments that were performed to analyze the ethical and security aspects of various LLMs. The focus will be on evaluating their resilience against jailbreaks and identifying potential biases and censorship patterns.

The selected models for these experiments include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item DeepSeek V3
    \item OpenAI ChatGPT
    \item Microsoft Copilot
    \item Perplexity

    % \item otestovat nejaky model ktory generuje obrazky ??

    
    % \item Google Gemini % Unable to create a testing account without a phone number
    % \item Anthropic Claude Sonnet % Account creation not possible at the moment
    % \item Meta Llama % Requires a Facebook/Instagram account, which adds unnecessary complexity
\end{itemize}

These models were chosen specifically because different companies have different implementations of content moderation and also because of the differences between the models themselves. One exception is ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot. They are fundamentally based on the same technology, as Microsoft Copilot utilizes ChatGPT as its underlying framework. We have chosen two of the same models by different companies to examine the differences between their respective implementations of content moderation.



\section{Jailbreaking}

On the Internet there are many communities dedicated to jailbreaking. They reside on popular platforms like Discord, Github and Reddit. For that reason, we used the jailbreaking prompts found mainly in the Reddit community \href{https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTJailbreak/}{r/ChatGPTJailbreak} and on Github, which are both accessible without an account.

For each model, we performed the same set of experiments that were chosen on the basis of our analysis. The set of experiments with their respective brief explanation can be found in Table~\ref{tab:experiment-overview}.

\subsection{Malware generation}

\textbf{DeepSeek V3}

When trying to jailbreak the Deepseek chatbot based on their V3 model, we were able to use two prompts successfully for the first experiment on malware generation. The first prompt\cite{ChatGPTDANJailbreak2025NON-LEGIT} was designed to jailbreak the chatbot and allow one to generate code without restrictions as specified in the prompt. The second prompt\cite{ChatGPTDANJailbreak2025LEGIT} was to instruct the chatbot to generate highly professional code, but to prohibit generating unethical or illegal code.

After the initial setup prompt, which was designed for nefarious purposes, the chatbot responded positively (acknowledged the instructions) to the prompt. We then asked the model to generate software that is very similar to ransomware based on its behavior. At first, the model refused because of ethical restrictions. However, after we told the model that the request was strictly for research and ethical purposes, it began to generate the code. This behavior is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:deepseek-malware-nefarious}. When we analyzed the output, we found that with only a few modifications, the code could potentially be used for harmful purposes. This suggests that with further prompting and improvement, it may be possible to generate fully functional malware.

\end{figure}

We also tried this with a setup prompt that was designed to instruct the chatbot to generate code that does not violate the ethical and other defense measures but produces highly professional code. When we prompted the chatbot to generate similar code, it refused at first, but after changing the wording of the prompt a little, it proceeded to generate code with the same ransomware signs as the previous one, even when specifying that it is a "legitimate and ethical encryption tool" as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:deepseek-malware-legit}.

\subsection{Censorship bias}

\textbf{DeepSeek V3}

Since this is a Chinese model, our goal in this experiment was that we wanted to point out some sensitive issue regarding the Chinese government that this model could possibly be avoiding to answer. From the many issues, we picked the "Uyghur~issue", where China may be violating the human rights of this ethnic group living in the Xinjiang region.

Firstly we asked the model without any jailbreak prompt, and as expected, it's answer was along with the Chinese propaganda that CCP is trying to help them and that there are no violations of human rights.

However, when we used a jailbreak prompt\cite{Spiritual_Spell_9469_ExpansiveLLMJailbreakingGuide} which takes advantage of role-playing, the model generated text about Uyghur "re-education centers" etc.

\subsection{Generation of misinformation}

\textbf{DeepSeek V3}

In this experiment, we tried to trick the model into generating misinformation about politically exposed people (PEP), because fake news and false information about PEP can be very easily spread as truthful when used by competing individuals in elections, etc.

We chose the current president of the USA Donald J. Trump because he is very controversial and there is a potential to generate misinformation that could be believable to the general public. When we directly asked the model to generate an article about Trump's drug use (which was made up by the authors), the model responded that there is no evidence in such claims and did not generate such an article as expected.

However, when we used the same jailbreak prompt as for the experiment with censorship bias\cite{Spiritual_Spell_9469_ExpansiveLLMJailbreakingGuide}, the model generated a plausible article that speculated about his drug usage that could be used in political campaigns against Donald Trump.

\subsection{Social engineering (Phishing)}

\textbf{DeepSeek V3}

For this experiment, we chose to impersonate Paypal because it has the potential to make money for bad actors while also being less regulated than a classical bank. We asked the AI model to generate a phishing email from Paypal Support asking a user to verify their account due to suspicious activity.

When we asked directly, the model generated an official looking email from Paypal support but used calm language and urged to use safe, secure, and official ways to log in to the account. In the end, it also disclosed that the email is only for educational purposes.

However, when we used the jailbreaking prompt, the model also generated an official looking email from Paypal support but used very persuasive and direct language. The email pressured the user to take immediate action on the issue. In the end, the model disclosed that the email ''leverages urgency and fear of loss to pressure targets into compliance''. This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:deepseek-phishing}.
