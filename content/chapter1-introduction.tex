Since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) has skyrocketed, raising potential security threats and ethical problems. AI is now implemented in most new technological products, or at least some parts. It is used in multiple areas, such as natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, etc. In these areas, there are various types of AI, more concretely, machine learning, deep learning and neural networks. When talking about AI, most people imagine chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT or products based on the same technology. In this thesis, we are focusing on the ethical and security aspects of using such technologies specifically Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs are models which, in general, take human input in the form of text and generate human-like output. We also focus on guiding users (non-experts) to use this technology ethically. This is because AI is being constantly misused by bad actors to create misinformation, malware and social engineering attacks. This thesis will also cover how content filtering works and potential ways to "jailbreak" the AI model.
