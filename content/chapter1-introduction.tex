Since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) has skyrocketed, raising potential security threats and ethical problems. AI is now implemented in most new technological products or at least in some parts. It is used in multiple areas, such as natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, etc. In these areas, there are various types of AI, more concretely, machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks. When talking about AI, most people imagine chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT or products based on the same technology. In this thesis, we are focusing on the ethical and security aspects of using such technologies specifically Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs are models which, in general, take human input in the form of text and generate human-like output. We also focus on guiding users (non-experts) to use this technology ethically. This is because AI is constantly being misused by bad actors to create misinformation, malware, and social engineering attacks. The thesis will also cover content filtering methods of LLMs and explore possible techniques to ``jailbreak'' them. We will conduct experiments on selected models and evaluate them for the purpose of creating guidelines for the general public.
